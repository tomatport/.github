# Tom's University of Portsmouth Work

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome! This is a place for meâ€”[@itsmeimtom](https://github.com/itsmeimtom)â€”to organise work undertaken while studying [BSc (Hons) Computer Networks & Security](https://www.port.ac.uk/study/courses/undergraduate/bsc-hons-computer-networks-and-security) at the [University of Portsmouth](https://port.ac.uk).

Most content will be private, but, in time, there may be some bits and pieces that can be made public. I'll likely publicise repositores from first year at the start of second year, for example.
