# Tom's University of Portsmouth Work

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome! This is a place for meâ€”[Tom](https://github.com/t5r7)â€”to organise work undertaken while studying [BSc (Hons) Computer Networks & Security](https://www.port.ac.uk/study/courses/undergraduate/bsc-hons-computer-networks-and-security) at the [University of Portsmouth](https://port.ac.uk).

Most content will be private, but, in time, there may be some bits and pieces that can be made public. 

You may also be interested in [my college work](https://github.com/tomatsolihull), or code by the [Computer Networking Society](https://github.com/UoPNetSoc).
