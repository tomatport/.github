# Tom's University of Portsmouth Work

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome! This is a place for [me](https://github.com/t5r7) to organise work undertaken while studying [BSc (Hons) Computer Networks & Security](https://www.port.ac.uk/study/courses/undergraduate/bsc-hons-computer-networks-and-security) at the [University of Portsmouth](https://port.ac.uk).

Most things are private and only visible to me and maybe my classmates, but you might find some of the things here interesting nonetheless.

You may also be interested in [my college work](https://github.com/tomatsolihull), or code by the [Computer Networking Society](https://github.com/UoPNetSoc).
